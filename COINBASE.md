# Coinbase Rewards

## Describes coinbase functionality for City Chain.

### What is coinbase?

[Coinbase](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Coinbase)
```
The coinbase is the content of the 'input' of a generation transaction. While regular transactions use the 'inputs' section to refer to their parent transaction outputs, a generation transaction has no parent, and creates new coins from nothing. 
```

### Proof-of-Work Reward

Initially when bootstrapping the City Chain blockchain, the Proof-of-Work algorithm was used. The coinbase reward for PoW blocks was `2` coins. The last PoW-block was allowed at height `2500`.

### Proof-of-Stake Reward

All blocks after height `2500` and future blocks, is generated through staking with the Proof-of-Stake algorithm.

The Proof-of-Stake reward was `20` coins initially from genesis and up until `1 111 111`.

At around February/March 2021, the coinbase reward for City Chain was divided by `10` in a consensus change. This made the reward `2` coins.

## 2021 Reduction of Reward

When City Chain was initially planned, a higher reward (`20 coins`) was coded into the consensus based on the assumtion that City Coin would be more widely used on global communities, cities and countries built around voluntaryism and freedom. The development of these communities has taken longer than initially projected, so to avoid too high inflation of new coins into the economy, there is a need to reduce the coinbase reward (`2 coins`).

A future increase back to a higher reward should be considered when City Coin is in more widely usage.
