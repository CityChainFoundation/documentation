City Chain: Documentation
-----------------------

Collection of documents used as architecture and technical reference for implementation of City Chain and Smart City Platform.

These documents are open-source and anyone can contribute, please feel free to do a PR with suggestions, additions, fixes, etc.

Don't expect all ideas and features written in these documents to be implemented. They are guidance documents, they should
document what already exists, what is being worked on, what is planned and ideas for the future.

If you discover a bug or other problem with City Chain or City Hub, please report it. The are two different processes, 
[responsible disclosure](SECURITY-ISSUES.md) for security bugs and public issue tracking ([City Chain](https://github.com/CityChainFoundation/city-chain/issues), [City Hub](https://github.com/CityChainFoundation/city-hub/issues)) for all other bugs.
